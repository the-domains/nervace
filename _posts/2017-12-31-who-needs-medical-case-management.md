## Who Needs Medical Case Management?

It's pretty well accepted that everyone should save for retirement, but just how important is it? Absolutely essential. And never more so than today. That's because the prospect of a comfortable retirement based largely on Social Security benefits or monthly pension payments is less certain than at any time since the Great Depression.

Yes, we'll admit it: We can't predict the future. Instead, we rely on probabilities. And in our opinion there's a high probability that, in the future, we'll all be spending more of our own savings to cover retirement costs.
